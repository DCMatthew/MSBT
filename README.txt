This is a simple update to MSBT to work with the 7.3 WoW API changes.

Please log out of WoW and copy the MikScrollingBattleText and MSBTOptions folders into your addons folder:

\World of Warcraft\interface\addons

This will overwrite any changed files from your existing MSBT folders/files - you'll need to accept these changes.
